# CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition 

I am taking the Standford CS231n course and I post this repository to share my solutions to the assignments and projects. 
The course lessons (2017) are avaible on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf7L7Kg8_FNxHATtLwDceyh72QQL9pvpQ) and assignments and class notes are avaible [here.](https://cs231n.github.io/)

## Assignment 1:
- Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier *(finished)*
- Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine *(finished)*
- Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier *(finished)*
- Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network *(doing)*
